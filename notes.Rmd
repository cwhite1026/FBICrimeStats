## Downloading non-FBI data

I have a different markdown file that has the FBI data but I can't get to it today.  Instead of just not working on it, I'm going to work on finding some other sources of data.  I would particularly like to know how guns factor into the larger scheme of things- what fraction of crimes are committed with guns?  What fraction of suicides?  What kinds of guns?  What fraction of deaths are firearm related?  Who do these things affect?
